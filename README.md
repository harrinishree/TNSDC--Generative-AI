Use discord to make this code work.
The secret keys and the Open api keys are with me.
This code runs efficiently by using "Replit".
This code requires you to keep your replit active and running since I have not kept my Repl in "always on" mode.
An alternative method is to use PING SERVICES : You can use external services like UptimeRobot or Pingdom to send periodic requests to your Replit app, which will keep it awake. These services will ping your app at regular intervals, preventing it from sleeping due to inactivity.
